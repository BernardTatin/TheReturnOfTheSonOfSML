# The Return Of The Son of SML

I don't like Java and I really like functional programming so playing with ***Standard ML*** make me feel good.

Because I never used this language family (SML/NJ, PolyML, OCaml, F#) in an every day job, I need a few evenings to recall what I knew. And every time I learn again *SML*, I do it in a knew way and always with a great pleasure.

## what you need

You need [PolyML](http://www.polyml.org), `make` and a good editor which can highlight SML syntax, like Vim.

## what to touch

The project ***hello*** in the directory `hello` is the best place to start. Don't forget to read the [`Makefile`](mk/README.pdf) documentation.

## a table of content

1.  the [`hello project`](hello/README.pdf), sample project with little experimentations,
2.  the [`mlTop project`](mlTop/README.pdf), a little `top` inspired project,
2.  [project management with `make`](mk/README.pdf).
