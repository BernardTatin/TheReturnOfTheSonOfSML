# The Return Of The Son of SML

I don't like Java and I really like functionnal programing so playing with ***Standard ML*** make me feel good.

Because I never used this languge family (SML/NJ, PolyML, OCaml, F#), I need
a few evenings to recall what I knew. And every time I learn again SML, I do it
in a knew way.
